# Cluster

<br>

## Description

Cluster allows users to create groups, add friends, and connect by creating group posts. Using Metamask, users can create paid groups granting control over who can join the group. Using our proprietary database, users can dynamically post and comment on each other's posts. We have created the perfect environment to interact with hundreds of like-minded individuals.

To support Web3 adoption and contribute to Cluster's growth, Metamask users can create a group that will cost ETH to join with a 5% fee that goes to the Cluster Treasury as a source of revenue via our smart contract housed on Gorli Testnet.

## Usage

If you have a metamask account, you can choose to login that way.
